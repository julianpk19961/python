# Variables in Python

# How do create a variable and store some data in python?
# Here are the steps we might need to follow.

# Declare a lable to the memory location - Variable Name
# Assign the value using 'Equals0 ('==') - Assignment
# #Given the required value - Data needed to be stored

# Defining a variable in python
# Let's say, we have an application that needs to store the name of countries.
# So here's how we will define a variable for it,

country = 'Colombia'

# Simple, ins't it?
# Now let's say, we want to print the value that the variable 'country' holds                                                               [Holds = Sostiene/Contiene]
# How to do that? We will just pass the variable name to the print() function, rather than passing a value is needed to be printed.         [rather = Mejor que/Mucho mEjor que]

print(country)

# Rules

# Here are some set of rules that you might need to follow while declaring a variable
#   A variable name should be meaningful and descriptive [Meaningful = Significativo/Útil/Valido]
#   A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character                                                                    [Underscore = Guión Bajo ]
#   A variable name cannot start with a number
#   A variable name can only contain alpha-mumeric characters and underscores (A...z,0...9,_)
#   Variable names in Python are case-sensitive, this means country,Country,COUNTRY and CoUnTry are four different variables.
#   A value, if it is a word or a characther, has to be encosled in double or single quotes.
