# Types of data
# A variable is used to store any type of data that is required by the application
# That data can be a word, a number, a decimal, etc.
# For example:

name = 'Jhon'
age = 23
bodyTemperature = 98.4

# Here, we can see three variables, name, age and bodyTemperature which hold their respective values. [Hold = Sostener]
# But, all these variables hold different types of value.
# The brings us to the concept of 'Data Types' in Python [ The brings us to = Esto nos lleva (a/al) ]

# Data type - what is it?
# Data types are the classification or categorization of data items.
# The basically are various types of data that variable can hold, which in turn, defines the type of variable.
# It represents the type of value that tells what operations can be performed on a particular data.
