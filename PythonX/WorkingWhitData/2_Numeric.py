# Numeric types

# The most basic data types in Python are numeric, String, and Boolean.
# In this section, we will start with the Python numeric type.
#  Numeric type in Python consists of,
#   -Integer
#   -Floating point
#   -Complex

# Let's discuss them in detail

# Floating point:
# Floating-point type is also called 'float'. These are the variebles that hold real numbers
# and are written with a decimal point dividing the integer and fractional parts.

# In simple words, a number that has a decimal falls under the floating-point type.
# For example:

temperature = 35.6
rateOfInterest = 2.5

# Here, temperature and rateOfInterest, both varuables are of type 'float'.

# Complex number
#   a + bi
# real part + imaginary part
# Let's go back to our school math. What is a complex number?
